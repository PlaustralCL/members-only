# Members Only

The purpose of this project was to practice using authentication for Ruby on Rails apps, specifically the use of the Devise gem. This is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/members-only).

The quotes used on the heroku app came from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

The live version of the app can be seen at https://vast-plateau-14135.herokuapp.com/
